I have joined multiple Scala courses by [Rock The JVM](https://www.youtube.com/@rockthejvm) in this repo. This repo is made for me to practice Scala.

All code is from the videos in these courses with some additional stuff written by me.

This is from the course Scala at light speed by [Rock The JVM](https://www.youtube.com/@rockthejvm)


## Scala at light speed

Full course here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmtsMNDRU0BxryRX4wiwrTZ661xcp6VPM

The course has the following modules:
* [Hello Scala (Playground)](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Playground.scala)
* [Basics](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Basics.scala)
* [Object Oriented Programming](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/ObjectOrientation.scala)
* [Functional Programming (maps, flatMaps and filter)](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/FunctionProgramming.scala)
* [Pattern Matching](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/PatternMatching.scala)
* [Advanced (Monads)](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Advanced.scala)

## Top 10 Scala skills

I have included the code from the video 
[Top 10 skills to learn to be a Scala developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVDgurLi-CA). 
This video is a nice introduction to Scala which I felt like complements the Scala at light speed course. 

The code from this video can be found at [ScalaIntroduction](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/ScalaIntroduction.scala)

## Monads for beginners

I have included code from the video 
[A monads approach for beginners, in scala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-dy1x33moA).
This video is for Scala programmers with some essential skills (generics, Options and how flatMap works on lists).
Written version can be found here: https://blog.rockthejvm.com/monads/

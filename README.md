# Scala at light speed

This is from the course Scala at light speed by [Rock The JVM](https://www.youtube.com/@rockthejvm)

Full course here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmtsMNDRU0BxryRX4wiwrTZ661xcp6VPM

The course has the following modules:
* [Hello Scala (Playground)](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Playground.scala)
* [Basics](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Basics.scala)
* [Object Oriented Programming](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/ObjectOrientation.scala)
* [Functional Programming (maps, flatMaps and filter)](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/FunctionProgramming.scala)
* [Pattern Matching](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/PatternMatching.scala)
* [Advanced (Monads)](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Advanced.scala)

I have also included the code from the video 
[Top 10 skills to learn to be a Scala developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVDgurLi-CA). 
This video is a nice introduction to Scala which I felt like complements the Scala at light speed course. 
The code from this video can be found at [ScalaIntroduction](src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/ScalaIntroduction.scala)

All code is from the videos in these courses with some additional stuff written by me.
